Generate a detailed P&ID for a single-duct, multiple-zone HVAC system with Variable Air Volume (VAV) units following ISA/ANSI standards. The system consists of an air mixing section combining outside and return air, parallel cooling and heating paths with respective coils (CC and HC) and dedicated supply fans (SF_Cool and SF_Heat), and three VAV-controlled zones with return air system. Include all instrumentation: temperature sensors for mixed air (MAT), supply air (SAT), and zone temperatures (Z1T, Z2T, Z3T); airflow sensors for supply and return fans (AF_SF, AF_RF); CO2 sensors for each zone (CO2_1, CO2_2, CO2_3); and actuators including VAV controllers (VAV1A, VAV2A, VAV3A), cooling coil valve (CC_A), and heating coil valve (HC_A). Show control loops for zone temperature control, fan speed control, and mode selection. Use ISA/ANSI standard symbols: circles for control room instruments, diamonds for shared displays, squares for local instruments, and hexagons for PLCs. Use solid lines for air flow, dashed for instrument signals, and double lines for control networks. Follow ISA-5.1 tag numbering convention. Layout should flow left to right with return air bottom to top. Show clear boundaries between mixing, cooling, heating, zone distribution, and return sections. Include PLC controller with I/O connections, emergency stop circuit, system status indicators, and alarm conditions. Add operating ranges (temperature 16-30Â°C, CO2 400-1500ppm, fan speed 1200-1600 RPM, valve positions 0-100%), safety conditions (emergency shutdown, temperature limits, CO2 limits, fan faults), and operating sequences (startup, shutdown, mode transitions, alarm responses). Ensure diagram shows complete relationship between all process variables and control elements.
