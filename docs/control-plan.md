# HVAC Control Plan

This document outlines the control plan for the HVAC system, including control logic, sensors, actuators, and operational sequences. Adapted from the Desalination project structure.

## Overview
- Description of the HVAC system's control objectives for multiple rooms
- Key components: sensors, actuators, controllers for each room

## Control Logic
- Independent temperature and humidity regulation for each room
- Fan and compressor control per room
- Shared and dedicated equipment handling
- Safety and fault handling (room-specific and global)

## Sequence of Operations
1. System startup and initialization (all rooms)
2. Monitoring environmental conditions in each room
3. Adjusting outputs based on setpoints for each room
4. Shutdown and safety procedures (room and system level)

## Sensors and Actuators
- List of sensors (temperature, humidity, etc.) for each room
- List of actuators (fans, dampers, compressors) per room

## Diagrams
- (Insert control logic diagrams for multi-room setup as needed)
